# Rust Lifetimes
For a moment, we're going to diverge from CosmWasm to focus a little on Rust lifetimes. The `cw721-base` contract makes extensive use of them so that it can be used in as a template for other CW721 spec contracts. We'd like you to get accustomed to seeing them, though we will not be writing much code using them in this course. We'll be following some of the examples from the [Rust by Example documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html)

A lifetime annotation in Rust is a construct the borrow checker uses to ensure all borrows are valid. You can think of lifetimes as sort of scope for borrowing; they are promises that the any references will be valid for the entire length of the lifetime. Lifetimes become of concern when the code crosses function boundaries.
