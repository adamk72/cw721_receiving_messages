# Title
Instantiate and Mint for the Cw721-Base Contract

# Description 
We went over the structure that makes up the `cw721-base` contact; in this lesson, we will go over the Instantiate and Mint function, which will lay the groundwork for understanding our upcoming custom contract. Completing the Instantiate function will also show us how the `Item` object works while working on the Mint function will show us how the `IndexedMap` object works in practical terms.
