# Title
Add `ReceiveNft` to Portal Contract

# Description 
While it's common in the NFT world for an NFT to be owned by a user account, NFTs can also be owned and managed by contracts. In this lesson, we'll show how the CW721 spec supports sending NFTs across the network to another contract. In our case, the destination will be our trusty Jump Ring portal contract.
